A total of 1,500 ETH is expected to be raised.\n- X2Y2 tokens sold at ILO are unlocked linearly per block within 360 days.\n\n### What is the purpose of this event?\n\nThe goal of this event is to provide liquidity on Uniswap. After the sale, 10,000,000 (1%) X2Y2 tokens + 1,500 ETH will be put into Uniswap to create the initial liquidity. All LP Tokens will be burned to [`0x...dead`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead), thus locking the liquidity permanently.\n\n### Has there been a private sale?\n\nX2Y2 did not hold any private round to \"strategic investors\" and will only do a public liquidity pre-sale based on a whitelisting system: the Initial Liquidity Offering.\n\n### What would happen if not all slots get sold?\n\nIf 1,000 slots does not get sold out during the ILO after the whitelisted sale and public sale, the remained slots will be burned and X2Y2 tokens to bootstrap the initial liquidity will also be reduced proportionally.\n\n### Do I have to be whitelisted to join?\n\nThis ILO is open to whitelisted addresses during the first 16 hours. After then, if the 1000 slots are not sold out, the remaining slots are going into public sale so everyone could join in.\n\n### What are the goods for joining the ILO?\n\n- You get 15,000 X2Y2 tokens at a price(1 X2Y2 = 0.0001 ETH) much lower than the initial price on Uniswap(1 X2Y2 = 0.00015 ETH), linearly unlocking for 360 days.\n- Share the X2Y2 NFT market fee earnings as long as you don't withdraw.\n- You get qualified to claim a founder edition NFT of Ajin Youth Rebels, the official X2Y2 collection, for free later.\n\n### Which networks will be supported?\n\nYou may participate in the Initial Liquidity Offering using Ethereum. Here's what you need for both:\n\n- Metamask Wallet\n- ETH - this is used to pay for the token and the transaction fees\n\n### What is the total supply of $X2Y2?\n\nThe total supply of $X2Y2 is set to 1,000,000,000 tokens, with 1.5% allocated for the Initial Liquidity Event.\n\n### Who founded X2Y2?\n\nX2Y2 was founded by an experienced international team, primarily based in Asia & Europe. The team has already established a beloved multi-chain NFT marketplace.\n\nFor more details about ILO, read our docs [here](https://docs.x2y2.io/tokens/initial-liquidity-offer)\n"},88482:function(e,t,o){"use strict";o.r(t),t.default="# Privacy Policy for X2Y2\n\nAt X2Y2, accessible from https://x2y2.io, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors.

These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use Service.\n\n**2. Assumption of Risk**\n\nYou accept and acknowledge:\n\n- The value of an NFTs is subjective. Prices of NFTs are subject to volatility and fluctuations in the price of cryptocurrency can also materially and adversely affect NFT prices. You acknowledge that you fully understand this subjectivity and volatility and that you may lose money.\n- A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications, and could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility of NFTs.\n- The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, non-fungible tokens, cryptocurrency, and other crypto-based items is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Service and the utility of NFTs.\n- You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your transactions. X2Y2 is not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your NFTs.\n- There are risks associated with purchasing items associated with content created by third parties through peer-to-peer transactions, including but not limited to, the risk of purchasing counterfeit items, mislabeled items, items that are vulnerable to metadata decay, items on smart contracts with bugs, and items that may become untransferable. You represent and warrant that you have done sufficient research before making any decisions to sell, obtain, transfer, or otherwise interact with any NFTs or accounts/collections.\n- We do not control the public blockchains that you are interacting with and we do not control certain smart contracts and protocols that may be integral to your ability to complete transactions on these public blockchains. Additionally, blockchain transactions are irreversible and X2Y2 has no ability to reverse any transactions on the blockchain.\n- There are risks associated with using Internet and blockchain based products, including, but not limited to, the risk associated with hardware, software, and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to your third-party wallet or Account. You accept and acknowledge that X2Y2 will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Service or any Blockchain network, however caused.\n- The Service relies on third-party platforms and/or vendors. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such platform providers and/or vendors; if the terms and conditions or pricing of such platform providers and/or vendors change; if we violate or cannot comply with the terms and conditions of such platforms and/or vendors; or if any of such platforms and/or vendors loses market share or falls out of favor or is unavailable for a prolonged period of time, access to and use of the Service will suffer.\n- X2Y2 reserves the right to hide collections, contracts, and items affected by any of these issues or by other issues.
